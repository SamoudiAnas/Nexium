            <p className="text-grey">
              In 2010, our founder, Vasily, faced a daunting challenge -
              preparing for the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) while juggling
              an internship and evening classes in different cities. The lack of
              time and a conducive study environment made it incredibly
              difficult for him to achieve his dream of becoming a lawyer.
              <br />
              <br />
              During a train ride, a moment of inspiration struck Vasily. He
              wished for a convenient study tool on his phone to help him
              prepare for the LSAT. However, such an app didn&apos;t exist at
              the time. Determined to overcome this hurdle, Vasily took matters
              into his own hands and developed one of the earliest and most
              comprehensive LSAT apps on the market. The app quickly gained
              popularity, becoming the #1 paid LSAT app for over a year.

          />
          <div>
            <p className="text-grey">
              This success prompted Vasily to establish FutureSphere, an app
              development company with a strong focus on creating profitable and
              impactful applications. Building on their initial achievement,
              FutureSphere expanded their educational app portfolio to include
              exams such as SAT, GMAT, MCAT, and more, catering to the needs of
              a broader audience.
              <br />
              <br />
              As time went on, it became evident that the industry had much more
              to offer than just exam-focused applications. People began
              approaching FutureSphere, seeking guidance on how to develop their
              own apps, what it takes to succeed, and how to navigate the
              complex world of mobile applications. In response to this growing
              demand for expertise and support, FutureSphere expanded its
              services and evolved into a comprehensive resource for aspiring
              app creators - a company known as FutureSphere.
